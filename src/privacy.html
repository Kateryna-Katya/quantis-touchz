      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies to the personal data provided by users of the <strong>Quantis-Touchz</strong> platform to obtain access to AI practical applications, technical support, and participation in the platform's expert events.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Quantis-Touchz</strong> reserves the right to make changes to the current provisions of this Policy. Please note that our materials may contain links to third-party AI services that have their own rules. In such cases, we are not responsible for the policies of third-party companies. By providing your data, you consent to its processing in the ways provided for by this document.
      </p>

      <h2>Procedure for Collection, Storage, and Destruction of Data</h2>
      <p>
        We collect personal data exclusively to provide high-quality access to technology: participation in intensives, receiving guides, and personal consultations. To prevent leaks, a set of information security measures compliant with EU standards is used.
      </p>

      <p>
        The maximum data retention period is 75 years (for archival records and legal security); however, in most cases, data is stored until the termination of the platform's activities or the withdrawal of consent by the user.
      </p>

      <p>
        The destruction or anonymization of data is performed to exclude the possibility of further processing once the purpose of collection has been achieved or upon the user's request.
      </p>
